Hi, my name is Marcos Oliveira, I'm a programming student and I'm 30 years old.

I'm interested in getting a job internship in the programming field where my biggest goal is to acquire deeper knowledge in the field as well as cooperate with the team delivering my best.

I currently have knowledge in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and I've developed some simple WordPress sites. Currently I'm dedicated to learning code versioning, because I know it's something essential for a programmer.
